# 🌸 Dear Diary – My Personal Planner Web App 🌸

Hey everyone! 👋

Welcome to **Dear Diary**, a passion project that began as my attempt to build a personal digital planner — a space to organize academic life with custom scheduling, subject tracking, and task management. It’s built using **SQL Server**, **Express APIs**, and a custom authentication system.

Though the foundation has been laid, many parts of the app — especially **several pages and their corresponding APIs** — are still **not implemented yet**. It’s a work-in-progress, and I’m sharing it as a step in the journey, not the destination. 😊

## 💡 Currently Working Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication**  
  Secure login/signup system with token-based sessions.

- 📚 **Course Tracking**  
  Users can add subjects and associate weekly topics.

- 🗓️ **Custom Timetable View**  
  Dynamically renders a weekly view using SQL + API calls (basic structure in place).

- ✅ **Task Management**  
  Tasks and quizzes can be added per course and stored in SQL Server.

- 📈 **Progress Logging**  
  Track which topics are completed and see your academic progress.

## 🚧 Not Implemented Yet

- Several frontend pages (like mood tracker, full dashboard, calendar view)  
- APIs for incomplete pages  
- Advanced features like note tagging, search filters, visual mood stats

## 🎯 Why I’m Sharing It Anyway

Even though it's incomplete, I’ve already learned so much — from building API routes to understanding database joins and session handling. Sometimes, progress doesn’t look like perfection — it looks like **showing up**, **committing code**, and **learning from bugs**.

## 💬 Want to Help?

This project is open to exploration and contributions. If you’re curious, feel free to clone it, build on it, or leave suggestions. There’s a lot of room for creativity and growth!

> 🛠️ **To Contributors**: Since many APIs and pages aren’t yet built, feel free to help expand the backend or complete any planned features!

## 🤍 Final Thoughts

If you’ve ever paused a project mid-way — you're not alone. This is me hitting “Share” even when it’s not perfect, because every line of code written is a line learned.

Thanks for stopping by. 🌱
